# Calculator-keyboard
This is a calculator that's work with a keyboard. 

First Javascript, I've got inspiration from some YouTube videos, but it's quite different from what I've seen so far. 

The only reason I made this project was to train myself in javascript. I will no longer be updating it, I may make a better one in the future.
